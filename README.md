# Language Benchmark
This benchmark is a problem that can be easily parallelized. The problem is too perform a dot product calculation on two 1500x1500 matrices.

# Data format
There are two data files which are the binary data for the matrices. The data is provided as 32-bit unsigned integers starting with the top-left of the matrix and going across the row to the right and then starting over on the next row (left -> right).
